## NotesFromOtherCourses

I am a current student at Lambda School in CS10.

I've found that attending lectures for my own class as well as listening to lectures for the class before mine (and taking notes) has helped me to better understand the material and not be so overwhelmed with all of the new content.

This is a repository for me to push my notes from other classes in order to keep them organized and all in one place.

I hope my notes help you as they help me.
