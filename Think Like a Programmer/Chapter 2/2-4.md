#### Observations:

1. I'm going to regret this.

More seriously:

```
Row 1   - 3 spaces, 1 hash, 6 spaces, 1 hash, 3 spaces
Row 2   - 2 spaces, 3 hash, 4 spaces, 3 hash, 2 spaces
Row 3   - 1 spaces, 5 hash, 2 spaces, 5 hash, 1 spaces
Row 4   - 0 spaces, 7 hash, 0 spaces, 7 hash, 0 spaces
Row 5   - 0 spaces, 7 hash, 0 spaces, 7 hash, 0 spaces
Row 6   - 0 spaces, 7 hash, 0 spaces, 7 hash, 0 spaces
Row 7   - 0 spaces, 7 hash, 0 spaces, 7 hash, 0 spaces
Row 8   - 1 spaces, 6 hash, 0 spaces, 6 hash, 1 spaces
Row 9   - 2 spaces, 5 hash, 0 spaces, 5 hash, 2 spaces
Row 10  - 3 spaces, 4 hash, 0 spaces, 4 hash, 3 spaces
Row 11  - 4 spaces, 3 hash, 0 spaces, 3 hash, 4 spaces
```
