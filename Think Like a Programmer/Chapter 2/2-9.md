Write a program that reads a line of text, counting the number of words, identifying the length of the longest word, and greatest number of vowels in a word and/or any other statistics you can think of.

#### The Mischief So Far:

Knew that I wanted to be able to put the input into a string, so devised a function called getText that parses each character from cin and then puts them into a string.

I also knew that I needed a way to be able to count words. This is a little tricky just because there are so many different ways that words can be represented. Though it's not a failsafe, I decided to define words as letters following a space + 1 (unless the character being examined is the first character, in which case a space shouldn't qualify as another character). I chose this definition because punctuation can occur in a sentence and would always be on the left-hand side of the space, so a letter following a space should always be indicative of a word, but a space after a letter may miss words due to the use of punctuation.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;

char* getText() {
  int i = 0;
  char* text = new char[1024];
  char character = cin.get();
  while (character != '\n') {
    text[i] = character;
    character = cin.get();
    i++;
  }
  text[i] = '\0';
  return text;
}

int wordCount(char* text) {
  int count = 1;
  int i = 0;
  while (text[i] != '\0') {
    if (i != 0 && ((text[i] == ' ' && text[i+1] >= 'A' && text[i+1] <= 'Z') || (text[i] == ' ' && text[i+1] >= 'a' && text[i+1] <= 'z'))) {
      count++;
    }
    i++;
  }
  return count;
}


int main() {
  cout << "What do you say?: ";
  char* text = getText();
  int words = wordCount(text);
  cout << "Probably should tell you the count to make sure it's working, eh?\n" << "Count is: " << words << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

#### Finally got a working solution:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;



char* getText() {
  int i = 0;
  char* text = new char[1024];
  char character = cin.get();
  while (character != '\n') {
    text[i] = character;
    character = cin.get();
    i++;
  }
  text[i] = '\0';
  return text;
}

int wordCount(char* text) {
  int count = 1;
  int i = 0;
  while (text[i] != '\0') {
    if (i != 0 && ((text[i] == ' ' && text[i+1] >= 'A' && text[i+1] <= 'Z') || (text[i] == ' ' && text[i+1] >= 'a' && text[i+1] <= 'z'))) {
      count++;
    }
    i++;
  }
  return count;
}

int longestWord(char* text) {
  int longest = 0;
  int i = 0;
  int counter = 0;
  while (text[i] != '\0') {
    if ((text[i] >= 'A' && text[i] <= 'Z') || (text[i] >= 'a' && text[i] <= 'z')) {
      counter++;
    } else {
      counter = 0;
    }
    if (counter > longest) {
      longest = counter;
    }
    i++;
  }
  return longest;
}

int vowelCount(char* text) {
  int i = 0;
  int vowelCount = 0;
  int currentCount = 0;
  while (text[i] != '\0') {
    if ((text[i] >= 'A' && text[i] <= 'Z') || (text[i] >= 'a' && text[i] <= 'z')) {
      switch(text[i]) {
        case 'a':
        case 'e':
        case 'i':
        case 'o':
        case 'u':
        case 'y':
        case 'A':
        case 'E':
        case 'I':
        case 'O':
        case 'U':
        case 'Y':
          currentCount++;
        case ' ':
        case '?':
        case '.':
        case ',':
        case '\0':
          if (vowelCount < currentCount) {
            vowelCount = currentCount;
          }
      }
    } else {
      currentCount = 0;
    }
    i++;
  }
  return vowelCount;
}



int main() {
  cout << "What do you say?: ";
  char* text = getText();
  int words = wordCount(text);
  int longest = longestWord(text);
  int vowels = vowelCount(text);
  cout << "\nCount is: " << words << "\n";

  cout << "\nThe longest word is: " << longest << "\n";

  cout << "\nMost vowels in a word is: " << vowels << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
