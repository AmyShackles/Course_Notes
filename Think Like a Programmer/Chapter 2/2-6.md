If you've learned about binary numbers and how to convert from decimal for binary and the reverse, try writing programs to do those conversions with unlimited length numbers (but you can assume they are small enough to still be stored in an int).

#### Breaking Down the Problem

In the Tracking State problem, we used `int number` to store the value of the current digit in numerical form and then for each digit that wasn't the nul terminator, we multiplied by 10 and added the next digit because we were working with base 10. If we're converting a binary number to a decimal number, we're working with base 2 instead. That means that instead of multiplying by 10, we're instead multiplying by 2.

```
#include <iostream>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;

int main() {
cout << "Enter a number with as many digits as you please: ";
char digitChar = cin.get();
int number = (digitChar - '0');
digitChar = cin.get();
while (digitChar != 10) {
    number = number * 2 + (digitChar - '0');
    digitChar = cin.get();
}
  cout << "Number entered: " << number << "\n";
}
```

##### What it's doing:

Given input: 10110

```
Outside while loop:
First pass:     number = (digitChar - '0')
                digitChar - '0' = 1
                number = 1

Inside while loop:
Second pass:    number = number * 2 + (digitChar - '0')
                digitChar - '0' = 0
                number = 2 (1 * 2)

Third pass:     number = number * 2 + (digitChar - '0')
                digitChar - '0' = 1
                number = 5 (2 * 2 + 1)

Fourth pass:    number = number * 2 + (digitChar - '0')
                digitChar - '0' = 1
                number = 11 (5 * 5 + 1)

Fifth pass:     number = number * 2 + (digitChar - '0')
                digitChar - '0' = 0
                number = 22 (11 * 2 + 0)
```
