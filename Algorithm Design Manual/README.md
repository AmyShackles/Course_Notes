Currently working through reading The Algorithm Design Manual, Second Edition.

I will be adding notes as I work through the textbook, though I will probably abstain from including formulae past the first chapter as it felt like an unreasonable amount of time to port it over into a markdown-friendly format.

### Notes
[Chapter One](./Algorithm%20Design%20Manual/Chapter%201/Chapter_1.md)

### Exercises
[Chapter One](./Algorithm%20Design%20Manual/Chapter%201/Exercises.md) - may be the only list of exercises I post to this repo
