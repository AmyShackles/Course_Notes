Currently working through reading The Algorithm Design Manual, Second Edition.

I will be adding notes as I work through the textbook, though I will probably abstain from including formulae past the first chapter as it felt like an unreasonable amount of time to port it over into a markdown-friendly format.

### Notes

[Chapter One](./Chapter%201/Chapter_1.md)
[Chapter Two](./Chapter%202/Chapter-2.md)

### Exercises

[Chapter One](./Chapter%201/Exercises.md) - may be the only list of exercises I post to this repo
