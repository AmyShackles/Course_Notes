## Algorithm Characteristics

Algorithm complexity

- Space complexity - How much memory does it require?
- Time complexity - How much time does it take to compute?
  Inputs and output - What does the algorithm accept? What does it return?
  Classification
- serial (sequential)
- parallel (breaks dataset into pieces and works on them simultaneously)
- exact (produces a known predictable answer)
- approximate (tries to find answer that may or may not be exact)
- deterministic (executes each step with an exact decision)
- non-deterministic (attempts to get to solution through successive guesses that get better over time)

## Common Algorithms

Search -> find specific data in a structure
Sorting -> take dataset and put it in order
Computational algorithms -> given a set of data, calculate another (ex: is a given number prime?)
Collection algorithms -> work with collections of data (count specific items, navigate among data elements, filter out unwanted data, etc.)

## Euclid's Algorithm

Find the greatest common denominator of two integers (largest integer that divides both with no remainder):
